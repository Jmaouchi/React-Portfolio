# Technology

**1. [JavaScript](https;//javascript.com/)**


**2. [CSS](https;//css.com/)**


**3. [HTML](https;//HTML.com/)**


**4. [Node.js](https;//HTML.com/)**
  Node JS is a runtime environment for the JavaScript language similar to how you would use a Python interpreter to run Python code on your computer. Node JS is being used to run and execute JavaScript code in the server to build backend services.


**5. [React](https;//react.com/)**
  React is a client-side JavaScript library, which means it runs on the user's machine in the browser, not on the server. ReactJS was created in 2011 by the tech giant, Facebook. The React library is used to build dynamic user interfaces and works by separating aspects of the user interface into what are called "components"

**6. [React Components](https;//HTML.com/)**
  React Components Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

**7. [nodemon](https;//nodemon.com/)** :

* nodemon is a command-line interface (CLI) utility developed by @rem that wraps your Node app, watches the file system, and automatically restarts the process
